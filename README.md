# üêç Python Etudes üéπ

This repository holds a bunch of simple Python projects serving both as an exercise and a demo of a particular concept or a technology.

Each project has a dedicated subfolder and is intended to work standalone. Please make sure to the read instructions as the installation and running process may differ from project to project.

## Common Requirements üìå

- All projects have been written for Python 3.12 or later
- All projects should be run in their own dedicated [virtual environment](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html)
- Depending on how they are going to be used, all projects may require local [editable installation](https://setuptools.pypa.io/en/latest/userguide/development_mode.html) via `pip`
- Some projects may require installation of their dependencies (specified in `pyproject.toml`) via `pip`
